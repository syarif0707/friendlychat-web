## Project Background
### Purpose
- This project is developed to show how the integration of Firebase into mobile web application can be very useful.
- Users can learn to untilize Firebase feature such as Firestore, Hosting, Authentication and more from this project.

### Objective
- To build a mobile web application that utilizes Firebase features properly which is:
	- Setting up Firebase project
  - Set up user login and signup using Firebase Authentication
  - Using provided database feature by Firebase which is Firestore to store data
  - Deploy mobile web application to Firebase Hosting
 
## Discussion
-	Firebase is a platform that designed help developers build and manage mobile and web applications efficiently. This platform is rich of features that not only useful for developers, but also very useful for those who are learning about mobile web applications. For this assignment, I am tasked with developing a mobile web application using Firebase to utilize its features. This discussion will conclude the features of Firebase, challenges that I faced while using it and why it is important for mobile web applications development.
-	One of the Firebaseâ€™s key feature that I explore during the development of this project is Firebase Authentication. This feature made the user sign-in and sign-up processes simpler and more convenient since it supports multiple authentication methods such as email, Google, Facebook and also phone number. Another feature that I learned is Hosting. Firebase Hosting is a feature that offers secure and fast web hosting, allowing the deployment of static or dynamic web content faster. I also learned how to use Cloud Firestore for my moblie web application. This feature is very important for its offline mode availability and real-time synchronization which are the key characteristics of mobile applications.
-	During the development of mobile web application, there are several issues occurred that make it difficult for me to finish this project. One of them is the I have problem while setting up the application. The instruction given by the tutorial was little bit confusing for me to understand but I managed to solve it with the help of my lecturer and my friends. Next, I also have a problem with my interface which is it appear much smaller than everyone else. However, when I sign in using my student email instead of personal email, it display the correct interface.
-	There are many importance of Firebase. One of the importance is it ease developers work by providing backend infrastructure like Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore which helps developers to focus on app features instead of wasting time on server management. Another importance of Firebase is it provided many features required for mobile applications such as real time synchronization and serverless database. This helps with faster growth of mobile applications that are advanced and rich of features
-	In conclusion, this tutorial is very helpful for those who are learning the development of mobile applications since developers can build a robust and feature-rich applications efficiently. This make it an excellent choice for developers that want to develop a feature-rich application without wasting too much time on database server management
